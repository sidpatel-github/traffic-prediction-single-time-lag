# traffic-prediction-single-time-lag

A prediction model to predict a traffic to next time interval is developed. Two different prediction models are used i.e. LSTM and CNN and 
their performance is compared in order to analyse which one is better.

This is called a "time series" problem and people are normally using LSTM for this kind of problem but after comparing the performance of 
LSTM with CNN I found out that CNN performs better.
